# incognito dB

Welcome to the open-source monorepository for [incognito dB][website], dedicated to ensuring user privacy. S'utilitza el codi obert proporcionat per l'empresa [Blyss](https://github.com/blyssprivacy) amb l'objectiu de proporcionar acc√©s totalment confidencial a una varietat d'articles. Ning√∫, ni tan sols el servidor en si mateix, ser√† capa√ß de con√®ixer el que est√†s cercant; tot gr√†cies als principis de l'Homomorphic Encryption.

> üåè The README file is available in [Spanish]() and [Catalan]() as well.

> üìÑ An article about the project is also available [here]().

## Why to care?

√âs dif√≠cil mantenir secrets en l‚Äôera digital. Malgrat la criptografia i les diverses legislacions implementades, el problema de la privacitat continua assetjant als usuaris en Internet. 

Amb cada missatge, cada cerca i cada interacci√≥; les empreses aprenen quelcom m√©s d‚Äôinformaci√≥ sobre nosaltres. Tot i que de manera a√Øllada pot semblar poc rellevant, quan es du a terme la suma total de la informaci√≥ recopilada, les companyies esdevenen capaces de descobrir molts aspectes de la nostra persona.

> I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today. After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won't have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.
>
> I studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview
>
> Please Note: You won't need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn't need to know. More info about that is below. I'll help you get there without wasting your precious time.
>
> The items listed here will prepare you well for a technical interview at just about any software company, including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.

> Best of luck to you!

Avui en dia, m√©s de 5000 milions de persones arreu del m√≥n estan interconnectades a trav√©s d‚ÄôInternet per tal d‚Äôobtenir o enviar informaci√≥. No obstant aix√≤, a mesura que tots nosaltres aconseguim informaci√≥ de les diverses plataformes a les quals accedim, aquestes tamb√© comencen a recavar informaci√≥ sobre tots nosaltres. I, cada vegada m√©s, el preu que hem de pagar per estar connectats √©s la nostra privacitat.

## What's for?

> ‚ú® Incognito dB √©s un motor de cerca de bases de dades dissenyat amb l‚Äôobjectiu de protegir la privadesa dels usuaris. 

Mitjan√ßant aquesta eina, qualsevol persona pot accedir a una √†mplia varietat d‚Äôarticles de manera confidencial. Totes les sol¬∑licituds d‚Äôacc√©s a informaci√≥ es xifren de manera que ni el servidor, ni cap altra entitat externa, t√© acc√©s a les cerques dels consumidors.

Amb la finalitat contrarestar la falta de privacitat en Internet, Incognito dB es recolza en els principis de l‚ÄôHomomorphic Encryption per garantir la Recuperaci√≥ d‚ÄôInformaci√≥ Privada (Private Information Retrieval, PIR). √âs a dir, implementa algoritmes homom√≤rfics que asseguren que els usuaris aconsegueixin la informaci√≥ que cerquen sense revelar cap detall personal o espec√≠fic de la seva consulta, gr√†cies al suport del codi obert proporcionat per l‚Äôempresa [Blyss](https://github.com/blyssprivacy).

Aix√≠ doncs, per tal de preservar la sostenibilitat en Internet, √©s imperatiu que el poder retrocedeixi de l‚Äôempresa a l‚Äôindividu i que aquest √∫ltim assoleixin la privacitat que li pertoca. Incognito dB es nomes una demo per intentar preservar la privacitat dels usuaris mentre √©s una eina util.

## Features and Benefits

* Built-in LSP ([Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
* Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
* Built-in remote development support inspired by [VSCode Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview). Enjoy the benefits of a "local" experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system.
* Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the [WASI](https://wasi.dev/) format (C, Rust, [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/))
* Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.

## Workflow

Through the above introduction and Demo demonstration, you must be curious about how DevOpsGPT achieves the entire process of automated requirement development in an existing project. Below is a brief overview of the entire process:

![Â∑•‰ΩúÊµÅÁ®ã](https://github.com/kuafuai/DevOpsGPT/blob/master/docs/files/intro-flow-simple.png)

- Clarify requirement documents: Interact with DevOpsGPT to clarify and confirm details in requirement documents.
- Generate interface documentation: DevOpsGPT can generate interface documentation based on the requirements, facilitating interface design and implementation for developers.
- Write pseudocode based on existing projects: Analyze existing projects to generate corresponding pseudocode, providing developers with references and starting points.
- Refine and optimize code functionality: Developers improve and optimize functionality based on the generated code.
- Continuous integration: Utilize DevOps tools for continuous integration to automate code integration and testing.
- Software version release: Deploy software versions to the target environment using DevOpsGPT and DevOps tools.

<br />

## Limitations
Although we strive to enhance enterprise-level software development efficiency and reduce barriers with the help of large-scale language models, there are still some limitations in the current version:

- The generation of requirement and interface documentation may not be precise enough and might not meet developer intent in complex scenarios.
- In the current version, automating the understanding of existing project code is not possible. We are exploring a new solution that has shown promising results during validation and will be introduced in a future version.
