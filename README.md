# Solitude Search

Welcome to the open-source monorepository for [Solitude Search][website], dedicated to ensuring user privacy. The open-source code provided by the company [Blyss][blyss] is used with the aim of providing completely confidential access to a variety of articles. No one, not even the server itself, will be able to know what you are searching for; all thanks to the principles of Homomorphic Encryption.

## :dart: Introduction

### Surveillance economy
It is difficult to keep secrets in the digital age. Despite encryption and various legislations implemented, the issue of privacy continues to plague internet users. With every message, every search, and every interaction, companies learn something more about us, making the price we pay for being connected our privacy.

While we are expected to be the owners of our personal data, to minimally participate in modern life, we are forced to relinquish this fundamental right. This is partly due to the proliferation of large and small tech companies that take control of our data, with the sole aim of profiting from it (what is known as the _surveillance economy_).

> A system that does not put users in control will – immediately or over time - be rejected by enough of them that it cannot become and remain a unifying technology.

### Browsing history

In the context of the surveillance economy, search history becomes a powerful tool for companies to understand the defining elements of our personality and preferences. Furthermore:

> In 2020, Mozilla published a study stating that search histories are 99% unique to the user, after analyzing 48,103 different histories.
>
> Mozilla Research. [PDF link](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2020-bird.pdf).

This demonstrates the uniqueness of search histories and how they are distinct enough to identify and understand users. It underscores the need to adopt more transparent and respectful practices in the management of personal data or to move towards an environment where cryptographic proofs are a sufficient justification to ensure that the company will neither use nor share the content of our searches.

### Solitude Search as a confidential tool

To counteract the lack of privacy on the Internet, Solitude Search relies on the principles of Homomorphic Encryption to ensure Private Information Retrieval (PIR). This means it implements homomorphic algorithms that allow users to obtain the information they seek without revealing any personal or specific details of their query, thanks to the support of the open-source code provided by the company [Blyss][blyss].

This prevents companies from analyzing, using, selling, or sharing our search data, which, as we remember, is 99% personal and highly defining of our identity. This is because the server has no knowledge of the information the user has searched for, despite having provided the desired content.
